<h3>If you need help with this plugin</h3>

If this plugin breaks your site or just flat out does not work, please go to <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/show-comment-policy/#compatibility">Compatibility</a> and click "Broken" after verifying your WordPress version and the version of the plugin you are using.

Then, create a thread in the <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/show-comment-policy">Support</a> forum with a description of the issue. Make sure you are using the latest version of WordPress and the plugin before reporting issues, to be sure that the issue is with the current version and not with an older version where the issue may have already been fixed.

<strong>Please do not use the <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/view/plugin-reviews/show-comment-policy">Reviews</a> section to report issues or request new features.</strong>

== Installation ==

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Go to Settings &raquo; Show Comment Policy, configure plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I use the plugin? =

Go to Settings &raquo; Show Comment Policy and enter the text you want to see above the comment form. Make sure the "enabled" checkbox is checked. Note that the comment policy will only be displayed on pages/posts where the comments are open. If comments are closed, the policy will not appear. You may also includes shortcodes which will be processed for output.

= I entered some text but don't see anything on the page. =

Are you using another plugin that is also trying to use the <strong>comment_form_before</strong> hook?

Is the page/post cached?

Are comments open? The comment policy will only display if comments are actually open.

= How can I style the output? =

The comment policy text is wrapped in div tags with class name "scp-comment-policy". Use this class in your local stylesheet to style the output how you want.

= I don't want the admin CSS. How do I remove it? =

Add this to your functions.php:

`remove_action('admin_head', 'insert_scp_admin_css');`
